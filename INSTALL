	pwsafe - commandline tool compatible with Counterpane's Passwordsafe

HOW TO BUILD FROM SOURCE TARBALL

   tar xzf <tarball>
   cd <dir>
   ./configure
   make
   make check     # to be sure it's working
   make install
   
And for the secure memory allocation to work, pwsafe must be install suid root

   chown root:root %install_prefix%/bin/pwsafe
   chmod +s %install_prefix%/bin/pwsafe


HOW TO BUILD FROM CVS

   cd <dir>
   aclocal        # generate aclocal.m4
   autoheader     # generate config.h.in from configure.ac
   automake       # generated Makefile.in from Makefile.am
   autoconf       # generate configure from configure.ac
   ./configure    # etc...; from here on you're on your own

You'll need autoconf 2.5 or better, as well as the header files for X11,
libreadline (which pulls in lib[n]curses) and openssl's libcrypto.

pwsafe builds cleanly on various linuxes (i386, sparc32, sparc64, alpha/debian
stable, debian unstable, redhat 8.0, 7.2, 6.2) with various g++ versions 
(3.4.2, 3.3.3, 3.2, 3.1, 2.95, 2.96 and even egcs-2.91).

pwsafe builds on NetBSD 1.6.1 if you use --without-readline (or go install libreadline
first) and gmake.

pwsafe builds on FreeBSD 4.9 if you use gmake.

pwsafe builds on Solaris if you first install openssl (for libcrypto). If you have
openssh you already have openssl somewhere, though you might not have the header
files. And you need to use --without-readline, or install that as well.

pwsafe builds on MacOS X if you use --without-readline (or go install libreadline
first).
