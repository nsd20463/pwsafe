2018-12-14  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: add '<unknown>' to the default ignore
	  list. It seems KDE's clipboard reader is
	  using that these days.

2018-10-05  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: merge in -t/--twice pull request
	  to work around Chrome read the clipboard
	  twice each time.

2015-06-14  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: merged pull request from github
	  user gahr which removed the need for
	  libreadline. That should solve a lot of
	  the remaining compatability issues with
	  different OSes, since libreadline was a
	  source of most of them.

2015-06-13  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: moved from sourceforge to github
	  https://github.com/nsd20463/pwsafe
	* pwsafe: merged in some of my local changes
	  from the past years, as well as some of
	  the patches sitting on sourceforge. Fixed
	  most of the bugs that had been reported on
	  sourceforge.

2006-05-15  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: fix SEGV due to unterminated string
	  in (too) cheap & dirty readline() replacement.
	  Thanks to Xavier for testing and reporting it.
	  The fixed code passes Valgrind and the new unit
	  test.

2005-09-30  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: corrected trim of name|login when
	  name or login were entirely composed of
	  whitespace.
	* pwsafe: release 0.2.0

2005-08-29  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: merged in patch for dbname bug I
	  introduced in the previous change.

2005-08-02  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: merged in patch for mlock() on redhat
	  FC3 that prevented the secure ram from being
	  utilized.
	* pwsafe: added functionality suggested by patch:
	  PWSAFE_DATABASE environment variable overrides
	  default $HOME/.pwsafe.dat

2005-07-31  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: fixed swapo in help text displayed
	  during random password generation. Improved
	  the grammer too.

2005-06-30  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: reversed order of notes and u/p
	  when doing a "-l(u|p)" operation and
	  outout is not going to the console.
	* pwsafe: fixed typo in --help text.
	* pwsafe: reworked test scripts so they
	  require sh rather than bash2. So now they
	  run on platforms with only sh. Also made
	  them work with pwsafe when built with
	  --disable-readline.

2005-06-11  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: reversed sense of diff output
	  during merge so -- and ++ make sense.
	* pwsafe: went through and cleaned up
	  compile warnings generated by -Wall.

2005-04-17  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: fixed segv in readline() when saved
	  is empty.

2005-03-13  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: removed selftest script and created
	  a new dir test/ for holding unit tests.
	  Added a number of unit tests.

2005-03-11  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: g++ 3.4.2 changed the interface from the
	  basic_string<> class to its allocator for the 3rd
	  time. Had enough with chasing non-standards, and
	  instead implemented secstring class myself.

2005-03-08  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: when doing a --mergedb, try the passphrase
	  of the 1st database when opening the 2nd one
	  before prompting the user.
	
2005-03-05  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: fixed socklen_t test in configure to #include
	  sys/types.h before sys/socket.h, thus making it work
	  properly on openbsd.

2005-02-18  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: added -q/--quiet at Jon Krom's request.

2005-02-17  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: apparently SUSE's autoconf's AC_SYS_POSIX_TERMIOS
	  macro sets ac_sys_posix_termios rather than am_..., so
	  now the if statement in configure.ac tests both.
	  (reported by Jon Krom)

2004-10-05  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: unknown tag/values in v2 files are preserved
	  instead of being stripped. This is probably the right thing
	  to do in the general case.

2004-10-03  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: added testv2.dat and added matching test to
	  ./selftest
	* pwsafe: added --mergedb
	
2004-10-02  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: added -G/--ignore with default value {klipper,
	  xclipboard}
	* pwsafe: added --exportdb
	* pwsafe: added --dbversion and support for pwsafe version 2.0
	  databases
	* pwsafe: now that we have -G/--ignore worked out, pasting
	  the login automatically advances the state. So now you can
	  say pwsafe -up NAME, <paste in login field>, <paste in password
	  field> and you are done. The old methods also still apply.

2004-03-01  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: first try case sensative perfect match.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.6

2004-02-27  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: you can now end the X selection
          paste pressing any key. You can still, as
          always, end it by selecting something.
        * pwsafe: fixed up build on MacOSX (sysconf(_SC_PAGEZIZE)
          doesn't exist) and freebsd (readline.h declares
          most things correctly, but not the callbacks)

2004-02-25  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: added pwsafe.1.in
        * pwsafe: fixed (harmless) "yes" "yes" output
          from configure.
        * pwsafe: print out character length of suggested
          random password (useful for sites that have
          a length limit)
        * pwsafe: when suggested random password entropy
          gets under 64 bits decrement by 8 bits rather
          than the usual 32 bits.

2004-02-20  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: added a cheap substitute for getopt_long
          to help out OSes that don't have it (solaris). 
          You can also use it by specifying --without-getopt_long
          if you somehow don't like the better gnu one.
        * pwsafe: fixed getyn(string&) returning true all 
          the time, thus not allowing you to not use the 
          default username. getyn(const char*) wasn't
          broken so most YN questions were fine.
        * pwsafe: fixed typo in question "user default
          username?"
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.5

2004-02-17  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: added configure test for readline.h's
          that are C++ safe but don't use 'const' in
          their declarations. (openbsd)

2004-02-11  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: fixed massive booboo in secalloc. It
          worked for me by a miracle.
        * pwsafe: added 'make test' target test.dat and 
          check script so you can verify that pwsafe
          works automatically.
        * pwsafe: always print out where we are going to
          output the username/password, so that the user
          can see in advance where it is going to go and
          abort if they didn't mean for it to do there.
        * pwsafe: added --with-openssl-dir=dir to configure
          to allow linking with openssl in other locations
          than the default.
        * pwsafe: added --without-readline to configure
          to allow building without readline (you get a
          cheap read(STDIN_FILENO) instead).
        * pwsafe: fixed gramatical error in error msg.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.4 to fix all these.
 
2004-02-09  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: implemented secstring and secalloc(ator)
          classes using mlock (like gpg does). You need
          to be suid root for it to work, though.
        * pwsafe: random number generator is seeded from
          ~/.rnd.
        * pwsafe: big hack to handle both g++ 2.9x and 
          g++ 3.[1-3]'s std::basic_string. Makes me want to
          implement my own string class and not depend on
          someone else's changing library.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.3

2004-01-26  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: fixed -V/--version segfault.
        * pwsafe: fixed getyn() brokenness.
        * pwsafe: improved searching algorithm, now
          if the string perfecting matches (without
          regex matching) it's a match. And added
          case sensativity of -I/--case or if search
          string contains uppercase.
        * pwsafe: Split OP_LIST into OP_LIST and OP_EMIT.
          OP_EMIT is implicit if -u or -p is given.
        * pwsafe: implemented -e/--edit. (Renamed -e/--echo
          to -E/--echo.)
        * pwsafe: implemented randomly chosen passwords.
        * pwsafe: fixed char-at-a-time (~ICANON) buffering
          on sparc.
        * pwsafe: release 0.1.2
 
2004-01-23  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: updated man page and usage()
          both of which were obsolete.
        * pwsafe: released 0.1.1

2004-01-22  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

        * pwsafe: initial release version 0.1.0

2004-01-08  Nicolas S. Dade  <ndade@nsd.dyndns.org>

	* pwsafe: initial version.
