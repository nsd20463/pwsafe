add from --input file for bulk import, and --export or --append
so you can merge and split db's. Maybe import/export to plaintext too.

use ConnectionNumber(xdisplay) to get fd and do the select() you
really want in emit() to X

Some way of entering multiline notes. Perhaps
the ole 'single . on a line' termination that
mail & smtp use?

curses based interface?

don't read entire db into RAM---just decrypt the name and the string lengths.
--add can be done w/o decrypting any strings!

pwsafe-agent mode (like ssh-agent)? with encrypted string like win32 passwordsafe?

avoid passing data to klipper & friends by doing a test X selection first and
seeing who grabs it. trick seems that klipper changed behavior. in kde 3.0
(redhat 8.0) it polls the primary selection. In kde 3.3 it takes from clipboard
rather like xclipboard does. Gnome must also have some sort of clipboard
daemon, but testing would mean running gnome, which I'm not too excited about
doing.
